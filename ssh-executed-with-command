# This script is meant to be used from within ssh_config.
#
# It fixes weird behavior of SSH where it returns error when executing
# command from command line while RemoteCommand was used in configuration file
# for this host, like this:
#
# Host pirx
#     RemoteCommand fish
#     RequestTTY yes
#
# Such configuration results in error when executing remote command:
# #> ssh pirx ls                                                                                                                                                                     Å›ro, 10 cze 2020, 11:26:07
# Cannot execute command-line and remote command.
#
# To fix this behavior simply add the following to your .ssh/config or /etc/ssh/ssh_config file:
#
# Match exec "ssh-executed-with-command"
#     RemoteCommand none
#     RequestTTY auto
